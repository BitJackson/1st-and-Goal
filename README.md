First And Goal
==============

This is a browser based web app that digitizes the rolling of the dice involved in the american football board game First and Goal (available here - http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95105/1st-goal)

Included are the teams from the available expansion packs, but not included are the cards that show that teams specific special teams dice assignments, so that the teams cannot be played properly unless the expansion set is owned by the players.

While fun, the games can drag out and get repetitive fast, so using this app, on say an Ipad or even a smart phone, lets you get through games much quicker.
